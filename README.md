# GFL PL Ranking Map 1 KCCO Movement Priority Visualizer

## Why?

Expand AI behavior is weird. It's not consistently predictable when just looking at the map. The hope is that this tool will mimic as closely as possible the underlying logic used for enemy pathing so we don't have to stare at a bunch of JSON like neanderthals.

## How to Install

Just download the thing and open the index.html file in your browser. No internet required. No fancy installation tools. Just browser. Or use [this online version](https://emerald-devel.github.io/gfl-pl-ranking-kcco-move-visualizer/index.html). Whatever floats your boat.

## How to Use

Left-click a node to change its faction ownership. Right-click a node to see the path the mob on that node will take and which node it's targeting.

## Disclaimer

Requires field testing. The pathing calculated is based on assumptions derived from experiments, not on any actual reverse-engineering or dev-verified information. Discrepancies may exist. Use at your own risk.
